### About this repo

Here are some Linux utilities recreated with C.  The goal was to learn more about systems programming, and communicating with the 
OS on a low-level.  The shell needs a lot of work.  Recreating a file compression algorithm was awesome.

### Future ideas
Do all of these projects again using Golang!
